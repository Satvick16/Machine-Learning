# Machine Learning

This repo contains a stochastic gradient descent visulization using recursion as well as notes from Google Colab's Machine Learning Crash Course. The visualization displays successive tangent lines of a hypothetical loss function. The colour of the lines gets lighter after each iteration.

### Prerequisites

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory is required to run .ipynb files.

### Downloads

* gradient_descent.ipynb: recursive gradient descent visualization
